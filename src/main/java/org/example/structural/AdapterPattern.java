/**
 * Let's say we have built a freelancing application.
 * 1. As of now, it accepts the payment through the mode of Paypal, very simplistic.
 * 2. This is start-up, and we are on a small scale. So I've used a library to do that. The website is growing big and now we have very different freelancers working on our
 * website. So now we started off a payment method of 'Credit' payment also.
 * 3. Also, we are using a library simple enough, when we had the paypal payment It is pay through paypal.
 * 4. It has a method of pay through paypal and when we have a new credit card library, it has a pay credit method itself.

 * incompatible interfaces, making them work together. This pattern involves a single class, known as the adapter, which is responsible for joining functionalities of
